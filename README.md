# Star Wars Lightsaber Battle!

This project was super challenging.  It pushed my knowledge to the limit. The logic got pretty intense at times but it wall worked out in the end!

The biggest thing I learned was about maintaining the state of the game. Knowing which character was chosen and who were the enemies and who was the defender.

You can choose any of the characters as who you will play through the whole game.

Then all of the other characters are your enemies.

Of those, you must choose in which order to defeat the enemies.

Once all of them are defeated you win! Otherwise when your hp gets to <=0 you lose :(
